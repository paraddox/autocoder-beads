# {project_name}

This project uses **beads** for feature/issue tracking. All features are stored in `.beads/` directory.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY WORKFLOW - NEVER SKIP

**You MUST follow this workflow. It is NOT optional.**

The beads commands below are your **PRIMARY communication channel** with the monitoring UI. If you skip these steps, users cannot see your progress.

```
bd ready                              # 1. Get next feature
bd update <id> --status=in_progress   # 2. MUST run BEFORE coding
# ... do the work ...
bd close <id>                         # 3. Only after verification
bd sync                               # 4. At session end
```

**Skipping `--status=in_progress` breaks the UI monitoring. NEVER skip it.**

## Workflow

### Starting Work

1. Check what's ready to work on:
   ```bash
   bd ready
   ```

2. Pick a feature and view details:
   ```bash
   bd show <feature-id>
   ```

3. **REQUIRED: Mark the feature as in_progress BEFORE starting any work:**
   ```bash
   bd update <feature-id> --status=in_progress
   ```
   This step is MANDATORY. It allows the UI to show what you're currently working on.

### Implementing Features

**After marking in_progress:**
1. Read the feature description and requirements
2. Implement the feature following project conventions
3. Run linting/type-checking to verify code quality
4. Test the implementation

### Completing Features

When a feature is fully implemented and tested:
```bash
bd close <feature-id>
```

Check overall progress:
```bash
bd stats
```

### If Blocked

If you encounter a blocker:
```bash
bd update <feature-id> --status=blocked
bd comments <feature-id> add "Blocked because: <reason>"
```

Then move to the next available feature with `bd ready`.

## Beads Quick Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bd ready` | List features ready to work on |
| `bd show <id>` | View feature details |
| `bd list --status=open` | List all open features |
| `bd list --status=in_progress` | List features being worked on |

## Project Guidelines

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Run `npm run lint` or equivalent before marking features complete
- Commit changes with descriptive messages
- One feature at a time - complete or skip before moving on
