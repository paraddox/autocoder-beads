# {project_name}

This project uses **beads** for feature/issue tracking. All features are stored in `.beads/` directory.

## Workflow

### Starting Work

1. Check what's ready to work on:
   ```bash
   bd ready
   ```

2. Pick a feature and view details:
   ```bash
   bd show <feature-id>
   ```

3. Claim the feature:
   ```bash
   bd update <feature-id> --status=in_progress
   ```

### Implementing Features

1. Read the feature description and requirements
2. Implement the feature following project conventions
3. Run linting/type-checking to verify code quality
4. Test the implementation

### Completing Features

When a feature is fully implemented and tested:
```bash
bd close <feature-id>
```

Check overall progress:
```bash
bd stats
```

### If Blocked

If you encounter a blocker:
```bash
bd update <feature-id> --status=blocked
bd comments <feature-id> add "Blocked because: <reason>"
```

Then move to the next available feature with `bd ready`.
